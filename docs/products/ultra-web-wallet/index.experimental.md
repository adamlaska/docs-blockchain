# Ultra Web Wallet


![](/images/web-wallet-main.png)

The **Ultra Web Wallet** is a browser-based, non-custodial wallet designed to enable seamless and secure interaction with the Ultra blockchain. It offers full Web3 capabilities through a lightweight, installation-free experience tailored for EBA (Easy Blockchain Account) users.

Unlike traditional browser extensions, Ultra Web Wallet stores the user's private key directly on their device in an encrypted format. This ensures user ownership and security while eliminating the need for external installations. 

To simplify integration, Ultra provides a unified JavaScript SDK (`@ultraos/wallet-sdk`) that supports both the Web Wallet and the Ultra Wallet Extension. This abstraction allows developers to implement wallet features once and support both environments automatically.

Whether you're building games, marketplaces, or dApps, Ultra Web Wallet makes onboarding and secure transaction signing frictionless for users‚Äîespecially those new to Web3.

::: info Note
 üîê Ultra never stores the full private key ‚Äî encryption is split between the user's device and Ultra's backend, ensuring secure key custody while maintaining decentralization principles.

# Airgrab Overview

## What we want

We want to be able to use 3rd party "quest" systems to ask their community to perform all kinds of actions such as: Follow user x, retweet tweet y, etc.

Unfortunately, these quest systems such as Galxe, only support EVM accounts.

To bypass this problem, we will collect the user's "EVM Wallet IDs" and the "points" they earned doing these quests and then publish them on Ultra.

Users can then link their EVM account using Ultra's Avatar system to then claim their reward on the whitelisted `airgrab` smart contract.

We want this smart contract to be useable by any 3rd project on Ultra, making this as a new infrastructure service.

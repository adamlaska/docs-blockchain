# settleauct.a

Settle an expired Uniq auction

## Technical Behavior

The action checks that the auction exists in the `auction.a` table with the specified Uniq with ID `token_id` and verifies that the expiration date was reached.

`executer` can be any account, including the auction creator and the bidder. No additional payment is taken from the `exectuer` account.

If the auction does not contain any bidder, the action will fail. To remove an expired auction without any bids, the `cancelauct.a` action should be used instead.

If `promoter_id` was set by the highest bidder, the account will be added to the resale shares list and the payment will be distributed accordingly. If no promoter is specified, then the default promoter will be used specified by Ultra in `saleshrlmcfg` table under a scope of `1` in `default_promoter`.

Resale shares in the global resale table will be initialized if they are unavailable.

Shares will be calculated and distributed based on the [2nd Hand Sale Policy](../../../general/antelope-ultra/2nd-hand-sale.md).

After the shares are distributed and no additional transfers need to occur, the token will be emplaced into the receiverâ€™s account configured during the bid, and the original token owner will have the token erased from their account.

The `auction.a` table will have the auction entry erased as well.

# createauct.a

Create an Uniq auction

## Technical Behavior

The action stores the auction to the `auction.a` table with the specified arguments. The new auction ID is read from the `next.nftauc` table, whose `value` field is then incremented.

`eosio.nftram` pays RAM usage.

Only one auction may exist per Uniq. The Uniq, which is placed on auction, must not be on a resell.

`starting_price` should be no less than `min_starting_price` of `auctioncfg.a` and also should be no less than `minimum_resell_price` of the factory.

`promoter_basis_point` should be in the range between `min_promoter_share_bp` and `max_promoter_share_bp` of `saleshrlmcfg` table configurations for resale (scope `1`). The default range is between 200 (2.0 %) and 1000 (10 %).

Time between `start_date` (or the time when the transaction is executed) and `expiry_date` must be within `trading_window_start` and `trading_window_end` of the factory. It must also be at least equal to `min_duration` and must not exceed `max_duration` stored in `auctioncfg.a`.

`duration` should be in the range between `min_duration` and `max_duration` of `offercfg.a`. If duration is longer than the trading window of the factory, it will be capped by `trading_window_end`.
